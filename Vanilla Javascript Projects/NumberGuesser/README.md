# Number Guesser 🎯

A fun and interactive game where you try to guess a random number between 1 and 100.

## 🎮 How it works
* **The Logic:** The game picks a mysterious random number every time you start.
* **Hints:** It tells you if you're "Too Hot 🔥" (High) or "Too Cold ❄️" (Low).
* **High Score:** It saves your best run (fewest attempts) to `localStorage`, so your record survives a browser refresh.
* **Sass:** Try entering a number higher than 100 and see what happens... 🤡

## ✨ Cool Features
* **Glassmorphism UI:** A modern "frosted glass" look with a deep violet gradient.
* **Haptics:** If you're on mobile, you'll feel vibrations on clicks and errors.
* **Animations:** The input box shakes if you try to submit an empty or invalid guess.
