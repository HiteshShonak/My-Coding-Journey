# 🚀 My Coding Journey: The Master Archive

> **"A living timeline of my coding evolution."**
>
> This monorepo serves as the central archive for my engineering journey. It hosts every project I build as I master new technologies—from Vanilla JS foundations and Java DSA logic to advanced React ecosystems, Backend architecture, and beyond.

## 📌 About This Repository
This is not just a collection of random scripts; it is a documentation of my growth from a student to a **Full Stack Engineer**.
* **Goal:** To master the MERN stack and Low-Level Logic (Java) by building consistently.
* **Philosophy:** "Build, Break, Fix, Repeat."
* **Status:** 🟢 Active & Growing

## 🚀 How to Run These Projects
Since this is a monorepo, each project is self-contained.

**For Web Projects (JS/React):**
1. Navigate to the project folder: `cd Vanilla-Javascript-Projects/Calculator`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use Live Server).
3. *For React projects, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.*

**For Java Projects:**
1. Navigate to the folder: `cd Java-Projects`
2. Compile and run: `javac Filename.java && java Filename`
